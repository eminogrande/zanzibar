    <h1>Traditional Textile Fibers in Zanzibar</h1>
    <p>
        In Zanzibar, a group of islands off the coast of Tanzania, traditional textile fibers are primarily derived from plant materials.<br><br>
        While banana fibers and coconut fibers are used as textile materials in some regions of Africa, they are not particularly prevalent in Zanzibar.
        Instead, the island utilizes other fibers traditionally.<br><br>
        One significant traditional textile fiber in Zanzibar is baobab fiber. The fibers of baobab trees are spun into coarse threads and then used for making baskets, mats, and other hand-woven textiles.<br><br>
        Another important textile fiber in Zanzibar is sisal fiber. Sisal is obtained from the leaves of the sisal agave, which is cultivated on the island. The fibers are extracted, cleaned, and then processed into ropes, carpets, and other textile products.<br><br>
        These two fibers, baobab and sisal, hold significant traditional value in Zanzibar for textile production. While banana and coconut fibers may be more commonly used in other parts of Africa, they are not the predominant traditional textile fibers in Zanzibar.
